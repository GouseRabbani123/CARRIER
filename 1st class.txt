Notes for Js

1. Javascript is a high level lanugue => there are two types of languages 

a. low level => low level means machine depenedent ex => copying the data is not done it is fixed to only one machine.

b. high level => machine independent lanugue ex=> copying the data from one machine to another machine using the pendrive "which means we can run the same code in differnt machines.


2. javascript is a interpreted programming langugue
 
what is interpreter do ? => what evr the programme that we writtereen it turns the code  into machine understandable languge on the spot.

while compiler dont do like that , it works as what ever code we writtern first it sends to interpritter then from there it converts the code into machine understandable language.
