 Normal :
html code runs on  , as the script tag gets the script code starts running, then after the excecution of script tag then again the html code runs and compltes .

Async:
both html code and script code runs parellel once the script code compltes it executes and then the html code also complets and excecute.

differ:
first the html compltes it part and excecute then the script starts running and execute its code.


suppose you have multiple scripts which are depend on each other then 
some scripts are depends on other and some scripts are depends on other 
then in such cases use "differ ".
in case you have your google scripts or some external scripts in your code which you need to execute with your code in such cases use differ.

imp: mostly use differ attribute becuse it maintains the order of execution of scripts.
